# [regexp.how](https://regexp.how)

This is a regular expression helper app which shows matches and examples.

It is a hobby project done to force the ins and outs of regular expressions to stay in memory and not fade away. Also to learn what I don't already know.

It is built using React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Vite and hosted on Vercel.
